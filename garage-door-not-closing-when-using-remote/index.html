Try using your remote to open or close your door to determine if the reprogramming was successful. Then, within 30 seconds, hold the button on your remote for three seconds or until garage door opener’s lights flash or the led light on your opener blinks. If remote commands open the garage door but are unable to close the garage door, verify that the garage door operator’s safety sensors are aligned and are not blocked. If your garage door remote isn’t working, you can manually lift and close the garage.
