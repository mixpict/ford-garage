If yellow and red leds are blinking slowly, the control panel is not compatible with your garage door opener. Thus, the flashing of the garage door opener lights can also occur when the safety sensors malfunction. Four (4) flashes indicate the sensors are slightly misaligned. In such a case, you will need to check with a professional if the wires to the sensors are disconnected and reconnect them to the opener.
