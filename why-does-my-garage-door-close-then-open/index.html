If the door stops short of closing, lengthen the close limit by turning the control knob in the direction indicated (usually counterclockwise). The garage door will automatically go in reverse whenever it hits an obstruction, such as the driveway or ground. In garage door operators made after 1993, there are required safety features that open the door during the close cycle when they detect something blocking the door. The garage doors also have a second system for automatic reversal.
