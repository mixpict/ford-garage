You have a broken spring. After a few minutes i realized one of the wires for one of the garage door eyes was covering the eye, so i moved it and the door closed. When a roller on the garage door comes off one of the side tracks, the opener won’t be able to lift the door. Can you see about a 2″ gap somewhere in any of the springs?
