      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List Of Garage Door Opener Closes Then Opens Again Basic Idea&lt;/strong&gt;, Once we fixed the laser and made sure nothing was blocking the beam, our garage started operating perfectly again. If the door closes before that set distance has been completed, then the opener thinks there‚Äôs an error and automatically reverses to prevent property damages or injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; src=&#34;https://mixpict.github.io/img/placeholder.svg&#34; data-src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/cssgaragedoors.com/wp-content/uploads/open-garage-door.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Why Won?t My Garage Door Close?&#34; title=&#34;Why Won?t My Garage Door Close?&#34; onerror=&#34;this.onerror=null;this.src=&#39;https:\/\/mixpict.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg&#39;;&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;
Why Won?t My Garage Door Close? From cssgaragedoors.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When any object breaks this beam, such as a toy, your door can open once again. When the door is in any position other than closed and the garage door opener is activated, the door will close. The symptom of this is a garage door that is in constant motion, opening fully then immediately descending, only to start the same cycle again. Doing this can save you some amount of cash.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;While your garage door is in the down position, disconnect the opener and try to raise the door manually. The easiest way to diagnose a track issue is to listen to the door as it opens and closes. If your garage door feels heavy to lift manually, you likely have a broken spring. I have replaced the batteries and purchased a universal remote.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
