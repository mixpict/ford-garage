Both led bulbs and openers use frequencies in the range of 300 mhz, and this means they can overlap in signals, causing the opener to malfunction. The light is offered in three different wattages—25, 35, and 120. The problem with using leds in a garage door opener is that they emit radio frequencies which can interfere with the functioning of the opener. However, the bulb itself will not damage the light fixture.
