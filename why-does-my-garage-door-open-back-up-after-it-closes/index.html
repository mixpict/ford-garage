<p>The opener sees that as the door not being able to close completely and, since that could be caused by something or someone trapped under the door, it reversed the door back to the open position as a safety precaution. Limit switch malfunctions — similar to the travel setting, the limit switch decides where the door stops when it’s opened or closed — if the door reverses direction, adjust your limit switch. Malfunctioning sensors can be caused by a blockage, dirty eyes, loose wires, or just bad sensors in general. Many doors have a photoelectric safety system.</p>

<p>Thunderstorms and windstorms can cause power outages and surges that may damage the electrical circuits that open and close the garage door. More often than not, when a garage opens or closes by itself, it may be because of a faulty circuit board.

<p>Automatic garage door openers are a convenient way to access your garage, but sometimes they go on the fritz. If your garage door fully closes, touches the floor, and then reverses back up, then you need to decrease the travel limit. Many doors have a photoelectric safety system. It goes partway down, reverses direction and goes back up again. The Woolleys.</p>

<p>A slamming garage door is a sign that the garage door spring is weak, and to prevent it, you have to replace the spring with a new one. This damage can cause the door to open and close on its own.

<p>A garage door that stops and goes back up is usually due to malfunctioning infrared sensors. A garage door that slams will not only damage the door itself but can also be hazardous to people’s lives. The garage door will close completely and then continue moving in the reverse direction, leaving you with a partially open garage door.

<p>The garage door can be operated manually by disconnecting the garage door opener from the door using the red pull cord. If it closes before the set distance is met, it may have detected something, so it goes back up to prevent damage or safety threat. You may face the situation when the garage door closes then opens on its own. When the door is in any position other than closed and the garage door opener is activated, the door will close.

<p>Limit switch malfunctions — similar to the travel setting, the limit switch decides where the door stops when it’s opened or closed — if the door reverses direction, adjust your limit switch. However, if the upper travel limit were set too high, meaning the door is actually being lifted too far, then the spring pressure that normally holds the door up could actually start to pull the door back down again. If the garage door makes contact with an obstruction while closing, the door will reverse, the opener will beep and the lights will flash 5 times.

<p>An opener that works smoothly has a circuit board that runs smoothly. This indicates that the springs ( torsion springs in the case of the photo above) are working properly and are not the issue. If the two sensors become misaligned, this causes the sensor beam to get cut off and can cause the door to reopen after being closed. Thunderstorms and windstorms can cause power outages and surges that may damage the electrical circuits that open and close the garage door.

<p>The garage doors also have a second system for automatic reversal. If it closes before that distance has been traveled, it thinks something is wrong — and it reopens to help prevent any damage or safety risk. This infrared sensor passes a beam horizontally across the opening. If your garage door fully closes, touches the floor, and then reverses back up, then you need to decrease the travel limit.
