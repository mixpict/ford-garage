Place a 2 x 4 piece of wood under the garage door. A common problem with garage door openers is when the door gets stuck halfway and refuses to close all the way down or closes smoothly but when it gets halfway, it reverses and opens all the way up. If there is anything that interrupts or breaks that beam when the garage door is trying to close, the door is going to reverse and go back up. Manually lift the door by hand.
