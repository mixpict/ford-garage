If your garage door opener has a locking feature, it’s possible that someone accidentally engaged the lock on the wall control panel. Set the short gable superdek wall sheets into the roller door flashing and pan fix them to the raking angle and header beam with 10x16mm self drilling screws (refer figure 2). To reduce the travel limit, turn the dial with a flat screwdriver in the direction opposite to the arrow shown beneath the dial. Having your garage door light blink continuously is not only annoying, it’s also a sign that there is something wrong with the mechanism.
