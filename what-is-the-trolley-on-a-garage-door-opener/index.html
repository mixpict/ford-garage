<p>The trolley on a garage door opener is the rail that connects the garage door to the garage door opener, and the trolley carriage sits on the rail and uses a belt, chain or cable to pull the garage door open or lower it closed. Garage door openers that use an operator rail turn a chain or belt. The cable (or in some cases the chain) attaches to the front of the trolley with a master link, and the chain attaches to the threaded adjuster also with a chain master link. The openers could be driven chain or belt or they could have a screw system. Openers/Parts Garage Door Guidance.</p>
